Negative Balance Protection
    When you trade using margin, or enter short positions, you run the risk of losing more than what you deposited, and going into huge amounts of debts.
    We guarantee that this will never happen to you by offering negative balance protection.
    On rare occasions, market conditions could cause your Equity to become negative. In these cases, we will perform a margin call: we will close all your open trades. As part of our policy of Negative Balance Protection, we will then absorb the loss and reset your Equity to zero.
	Negative Balance Protection is not a replacement for proper trading strategies. If you want to learn how to trade, please visit [The Trading Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGL9ubdGcvZh_dvSV2z1hoQ).
