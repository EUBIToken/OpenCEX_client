Coin/Token/Asset Listing

    There are a few requirements and a small burn fee.
Interested in listing your project?
             
    Jessie Lesbian Cryptocurrency Exchange is happy to accept up and coming projects. Unlike many exchanges, we do 
not rely heavily on huge listing fees. As a result, we would more look into project behind the coin/token/asset rather
than the foward budget of the project team</p>
In order to qualify the requirements must be met PRIOR to sending listing fees. Do NOT send fees without acceptance</p>
              
    Must meet requirements in list and have also proper listing fee.
            
	Upon acceptance you will be given an address which to send funds.</p>
Have an article prepared for the coin/token data (blog) page</p>
Your article will be your presentation to the world, try to make it shine</p>
Please note: we do not intend to 'trash' your project. If you receive a low rating...you are not only
welcome but encouraged to work harder and be inspired to get better. After a period of "training" you are 
allowed to resubmit <3

Steps to listing your project:

Step 1:
Meet project basic elements.
including, but not limited to the following:
Homepage
Blog branding
Roadmap/ Usage details
Community 
Financial plans
IRL usage network

Step 2:
Wait for review.
Your ratings dramatically affects fee.
The points breakdown is as follows:
Network: 20 points
Community: 20 points 
Social Net: 20 points
Business Model: 20 points
Core Elements: 20 points

Step 3: 
Deposit listing fee
as you know fee is points based heavily.
range points: 0- 100
range PolyEUBI 0- 50 000
each point = 500 PolyEUBI! 

Step 4: 
Build marketpairs by volume.
Initial listing fee includes pairing to PolyEUBI/Yourtoken and Yourpick/Yourtoken.
This means you are allowed to select one pairing.
As volume increases, your token will be paired with high vol. pairs OR next choice

Where does your listing fee go?
Your listing fee is sent to burn address
100% of funds sent are removed permanently from circulation
This will increase rarity and value of PolyEUBI longterm!
